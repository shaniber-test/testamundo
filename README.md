Testamundo!
===========

Testamundo! is a testing repository filled with random and wonderous things.

I use it to play with git, github, and other tools.  Please feel free to 
fork, or make a pull request (so long as it's not gross random things.)

Each type of random thing should be given its own directory.  A README.md
should be included, summarising what the content of the directory, as well
as giving a URL or pointer to the resources used to generate the things.  

Thanks for playing!
